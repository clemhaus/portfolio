      <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-600">Safran SA, the holding company of the Safran Group, is a
major French industrial and technological group with an international presence, specializing in the design and
production of aircraft engines, helicopters, rockets, aeronautical and defense equipment.
During this period, I discovered the position of Digital Supply Chain Engineer within the Industrial Purchasing
and Performance Department (DIAP), with the main mission of pursuing the Green&Flows project. This
project, part of Safran's CSR strategy, aims to manage the carbon footprint associated with the transportation
of goods.
My main tasks were to design the specifications for lot 2 in collaboration with the Information Systems
Department (DSIC), to lead weekly meetings (workshops) with various carriers to collect data to determine
our carbon footprint, and to process and exploit this data using Power BI.
These tasks enabled me to put into practice the skills I'd acquired at ESIEA, particularly in databases for
PowerBI table management, and in Python for efficient management of information transmitted by suppliers.
This assignment was a real personal and professional enrichment. I was able to improve my eloquence by
leading meetings in French and English with major players in the sector. I gained an in-depth understanding of
the sustainability and social responsibility challenges facing Safran and made a significant contribution to
strategic projects for the company.
I also had the opportunity to attend seminars specifically dedicated to the decarbonization project, where
various levers were discussed such as technological progress, the development of SAF (sustainable aviation
fuels), and modal shift by favoring maritime and road transport for certain air flows.</p>
